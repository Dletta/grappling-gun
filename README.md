## Introduction

Grappling Gun is a Chat Bridge powered by [gunDb](https://github.com/amark/gun), for gunDb.

Building upon the concept of [matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge), different listener chat bots are treated as [SEA](https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/sea.js) users that connect to one canonical source (a distributed Gun database).

## Roadmap
- [X] Bridge Gitter and Discord rooms 
- [ ] Store the canonical chat log in Gun 
- [ ] Create a UX for accessing Gun chat log directly
