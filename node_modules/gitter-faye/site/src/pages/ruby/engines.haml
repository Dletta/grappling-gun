    h4. Engines

    In Faye, the 'engine' is the back-end of the server; the engine implements
    the messaging semantics and deals with state and storage, and the server
    maps the Bayeux protocol onto the engine's functionality. See the
    "architecture overview":/architecture.html for more information.

    The default engine that's included with Faye stores all state in-process,
    making it fast but making it impossbile to run a single Faye service across
    multiple front-end web servers. The following engines are available as
    separate libraries:

    * "faye-redis":https://github.com/faye/faye-redis-ruby - Uses Redis to store
      state and distribute messages between any number of Faye server processes,
      letting you increase your connection capacity.

    h4. Creating your own engine

    The pluggable engine architecture allows anyone to write a new back-end for
    Faye that works the way they want. Engines are passed in when a server is
    instantiated, for example the Redis engine is set up like so:

    <pre>server = Faye::RackAdapter.new(
      :mount   => '/faye',
      :timeout => 25,
      :engine  => {
        :type  => Faye::Redis,
        :host  => 'localhost',
        :port  => 6379
      }
    )</pre>

    The @:engine@ field has a @:type@ setting that maps to the engine class, and
    further options that are used to configure that particular engine. Faye then
    uses the following API to interact with the engine; this is what you must
    implement if you are writing your own engine.

    h4. @Engine.create(proxy, options)@

    The object passed in the @:type@ field (for example @Faye::Redis@ in the
    above example) must respond to @create(proxy, options)@ and return an object
    that implements the rest of the API described below. @options@ is a hash
    containing the @:engine@ settings supplied by the user, for example in the
    above example it would be @{:host => 'localhost', :port => 6379}@.

    @proxy@ is an object that intermediates between the server and the engine,
    and provides methods the engine needs to communicate with the server. In
    particular it provides the following:

    * *@proxy.deliver(client_id, messages)@* - Tells the server to send
      @messages@ to the given @client_id@. Will do nothing if there is no open
      connection for @client_id@, so you should check whether a connection is
      open using @proxy.has_connection?(client_id)@ first. @messages@ is an
      array of hashes representing Bayeux messages.
    * *@proxy.has_connection?(client_id)@* - Returns @true@ iff the server
      currently holds an open @/meta/connect@ request for the given @client_id@.
      This can be used when deciding whether to flush a message queue.
    * *@proxy.generate_id@* - Returns a random valid Faye client ID as a string.
      It does not guarantee that the ID is unique; this is the responsibility of
      the engine.
    * *@proxy.trigger(event_type, *args)@* - Triggers events that the user can
      listen to using @on()@. The engine is required to emit these events at
      certain times as detailed below, e.g.
      @proxy.trigger(:disconnect, client_id)@.
    * *@proxy.timeout@* - Returns the server's connection timeout in seconds.
      Can be used to set timeouts for inactive clients.
    * *@proxy.debug, proxy.info, proxy.warn, proxy.error@* - Lets the engine log
      messages using the standard set of log levels, e.g.
      @proxy.info('Created new client: ?', client_id)@. Any @?@ in the message
      are replaced with the values of the other parameters, formatted as
      necessary.

    The @proxy@ also emits two events to let you know when a particular client
    connects and disconnects from the server. These correspond with the return
    value of @proxy.has_connection?(client_id)@ changing between @true@ and
    @false@. You can listen to these events using the @on()@ method.

    * *@proxy.on('connection:open') { |client_id| }@* - Fires when the
      client with ID @client_id@ connects to the server, either by opening a
      socket or sending a @/meta/connect@ request.
    * *@proxy.on('connection:close') { |client_id| }@* - Fires when the
      client with ID @client_id@ disconnects from the server, either by closing
      a socket or by the server sending a @/meta/connect@ response. Note this
      does not mean the client's session has ended, it just means it does not
      currently have an open network connection to the server.

    h4. The Faye engine API

    The object returned by @Engine.create(proxy, options)@ must implement the
    following interface to be a valid Faye engine. Note that return values are
    delivered via a block, which allows engine implementations to be
    asynchronous. Engines do not have to operate asynchronously, but should
    avoid doing anything that would block the event loop for too long.

    The engine should assume that all validation required by the Bayeux protocol
    has already been performed by the server for all incoming messages. The
    engine does not need to reimplement any of this, it simply needs to
    implement the messaging semantics.

    There are automated tests in the Faye project that you can use to make sure
    your engine conforms to the spec. See the
    "faye-redis":https://github.com/faye/faye-redis-ruby project for an example
    of using these tests.

    h4. @engine.create_client { |client_id| ... }@

    Should generate and return a new unique Faye client ID. You can use
    @proxy.generate_id@ to generate valid IDs, but the engine must make sure a
    _unique_ value is assigned. After choosing an ID and allocating any required
    storage for it, the ID should be yielded to the block.

    The engine should call @proxy.trigger(:handshake, client_id)@ once a valid
    client ID has been selected.

    h4. @engine.destroy_client(client_id) { ... }@

    Should destroy any subscriptions for the given @client_id@ and mark the
    @client_id@ as disconnected. No further messages will be sent by the client
    after this happens.

    The engine should call @proxy.trigger(:disconnect, client_id)@ in the
    current process, and should call @proxy.trigger(:close, client_id)@ in _all_
    the Faye server processes, after deleting the client's data. If a block is
    given it should be called after the client has been deleted.

    h4. @engine.client_exists(client_id) { |exists| ... }@

    Should call the given block with @true@ if the given @client_id@ exists, and
    @false@ otherwise. This is used by the server when validating incoming
    messages.

    h4. @engine.ping(client_id)@

    The server calls this to tell the engine a connection has been received for
    the given @client_id@. You can use this as a heartbeat to check clients are
    still alive. No return value is expected.

    h4. @engine.subscribe(client_id, channel) { |successful| ... }@

    Should store a subscription for the given @client_id@ to the given
    @channel@, both of which are strings. If a block is given, it must be called
    with @true@ or @false@ to indicate whether the subscription was registered
    successfully.

    The engine should call @proxy.trigger(:subscribe, client_id, channel)@ iff
    the subscription was successful _and_ the client was not previously
    subscribed to the channel.

    h4. @engine.unsubscribe(client_id, channel) { |successful| ... }@

    Should delete a subscription for the given @client_id@ to the given
    @channel@, both of which are strings. If a block is given, it must be called
    with @true@ or @false@ to indicate whether the subscription was destroyed
    successfully.

    The engine should call @proxy.trigger(:unsubscribe, client_id, channel)@ iff
    the subscription was destroyed _and_ the client was actually subscribed to
    the channel.

    h4. @engine.publish(message, channels)@

    Given a hash in @message@ and an array of channel names in @channels@, the
    engine should deliver the message to all the clients subscribed to the given
    channels. For example, if the message was published to @/msg/foo@ by the
    sender, then @channels@ will be @['/msg/foo', '/msg/*', '/msg/**', '/**']@.

    Each message should be delivered to each subscribed client _exactly once_,
    even if the client is subscribed to several channels in the @channels@
    array.  If the client is currently connected (see @proxy.has_connection?@)
    the engine should use @proxy.deliver@ to send the message to the client.
    Otherwise the message should be queued until the next time the client
    connects.

    On receipt of a message, the engine should call
    @proxy.trigger(:publish, message['clientId'], message['channel'], message['data'])@.

    Where applicable, the engine must make sure that any published message
    reaches all the clients that should receive it, whichever Faye server
    instance they are connected to. How the message is routed to other Faye
    processes is up to the engine.

    h4. @engine.empty_queue(client_id)@

    The server calls this when a client connects to flush any queued messages
    for the client. The engine should check the client is connected, and if
    there are any queued messages for it, use
    @proxy.deliver(client_id, messages)@ to send them to the client.

    h4. @engine.disconnect@

    This is called when the server is shut down. The engine should close any
    connections is has to external processes like databases and cancel any
    timeouts it has pending.

    h4. Disconnecting inactive clients

    When a client makes a connection, the engine will receive a call to
    @engine.ping(client_id)@. This tells the engine the client is still alive.
    Sometimes, clients fail to send an explicit disconnect message when they
    shut down, and the engine must detect such clients and delete them. If a
    client goes much longer than @proxy.timeout@ without sending a ping, the
    engine should do the following in this order:

    * Destroy all subscriptions for the client, calling
      @proxy.trigger(:unsubscribe, client_id, channel)@ for each subscription
    * Delete the client, calling @proxy.trigger(:disconnect, client_id)@ in the
      current process and @proxy.trigger(:close, client_id)@ in all processes
    * Delete any other state associated with the client's session

    The strategy for cleaning up inactive clients is up to the engine, but the
    important point is it will _not_ be explicitly initiated by the server; the
    engine must make sure this clean-up happens by itself and must trigger
    events so the user can monitor these timeouts.
